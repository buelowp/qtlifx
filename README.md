# Qt LIFX Library

Provides a Qt mechanism for talking to and controlling LIFX version 2 and newer bulbs

Examples coming soon

## Some early Notes

* This library is being developed on a PC, and is LE by default. 
* It likely will not work on a Pi right now because of that assumption in the code. I'll fix that eventually
* The API is still very early in development. It works for me, I don't know that it will work for anyone else ATM. More to come as I build this out a bit.
